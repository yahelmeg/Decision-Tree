# Decision Tree 

This project was a homework assignment for Artificial Intellgience course.
The projecte required me to construct a decision tree by using the provided data sets, the process involved
calculating entorpy for the labels and using it to find the attribute with the highest information gain by calculating the remainder.

The following functions were implemented in the project:

| **Function**        | **Description**                                                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DecisionTreeImpl`  | Creates a decision tree based on a training set.                                                 |
| `Classify`          | Classifies the label for an instance by traversing the decision tree.                            |
| `rootInfoGain`      | Prints a list of the information gained by each attribute of the training set in the decision tree. |
| `printAccuracy`     | Prints the accuracy of the classified instances' labels.                                         |
